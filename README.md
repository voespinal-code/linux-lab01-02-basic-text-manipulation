## üìù Pentest Assignment Tasks

### 1. Environment & Session Recon

**Management wants you to confirm your access is under your controlled user (not root), and show your current working directory.**

- Display your current username and present working directory.

**Command(s):**
```bash
whoami
pwd
 ```
![Step 1 Output](evidence/step1.png)

- Briefly explain why this information is critical during a pentest.
  
**Explanation:**
Knowing your current user is critical in a pentest because your permissions and access level depend on it. Knowing your present directory prevents mistakes like deleting files in the wrong location or running tools in the wrong folder.
